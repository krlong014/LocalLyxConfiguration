# LocalLyxConfiguration
Various lyx configuration files

Your local lyx configuration directory will probably be ~/.lyx on Linux and ~/Library/Application Support/LyX-[version] on a Mac.
I'll refer to this directory as ${LOCAL_LYX}

## Instructions
- layout files (.module and .inc) go into ${LOCAL_LYX}/layouts
- keyboard shortcuts files (.bind) go into ${LOCAL_LYX}/bind
